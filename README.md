# Starting out

Look at resources provided:
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/
- https://realpython.com/
- https://docs.python.org/3/


# Programming expectations and coding standards

## Communication is Key

1. ALWAYS name functions and variables as to their function
2. ALWAYS comment segments of code as to their function (Don't comment every line dummy)
3. AVOID hard coding values, make the code calculate the value in some way
- Example of incorrect code:
> one_divided_by_one = 1 # ✖️
- Example of correct code:
> one_divided_by_one = 1/1 # ✔️
5. IN THE FINAL PRODOCT always ensure that unused or commented out code is deleted.
6. ALWAYS provide an explanation for printing or displaying something in output.
7. ALWAYS provide a doc string in a function
